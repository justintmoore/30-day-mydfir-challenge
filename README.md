# elk-stack-setup
This is my first cybersecurity project, inspired by a video walkthrough from the MYDFIR YouTube channel. Iâ€™m working to replicate this project from scratch, with the goal of understanding and being able to explain every aspect of it. This repository will reflect my hands-on learning journey as I build a strong foundation in cybersecurity skills.
